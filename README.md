# KNN_classifier
Business problem: We have to predict the classes using KNN algorithm

There are 2 datasets :
1.  glass data: I have solved using R program
2.  zoo dataset:  I have solved this using Python

To improve performance:
    different values of k have been taken,
    test accuracy and training accuracy has been found out, 
    different ratios of train/test data have been chosen, 
    different seeds (random_sate) have been used.
    Along with KNN, multinomial logistic regression is performed in Python
